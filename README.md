# sj-bdl-client

## Set-up
- fork/clone this repo
- set upstream branch
- run the commands
  - install:          `npm i`
  - build + nodemon:  `npm run start:dev`
  - watch:            `npm run watch`

Development is easier if you run the `start:dev` and `watch` commands simultaneously
in two different shell windows
