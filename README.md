# sj-bdl-client

## Things you need to succeed:
- MongoDB (I reccomend you use brew)
- Robo 3T (postico for Mongo)
- Postman (or similar tech for mocking api endpoints)

## Set-up
- fork/clone this repo
- set upstream branch
- run the commands
  - install:          `npm i`
  - * build + nodemon:  `npm run start:dev`
  - * watch:            `npm run watch`

*Development is easier if you run the `start:dev` and `watch` commands simultaneously
in two different shell windows

## Contributing
- Issues will be issued the first day of the week. 
  - If you finish all your issues early, talk to Di to take on new issues.
- Branch should start with your issue number, and separated by `-`'s with description. 
  - i.e. `105-delete-reports` would be the branch name for issue #105.
- When a PR is ready for review, create the PR and send Di a message so she knows it's ready for review. 
  - Make sure to rebase before submitting PR!

## Notes:
- I do not mind comments explaining what a chunk of code does.
