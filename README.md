# sj-bdl-client

A web application frontend for the San Francisco Bad Date List (BDL) maintained by [St. James Infirmary](https://stjamesinfirmary.org) (SJI).

St. James Infirmary is looking for volunteer contributers to resolve [issues with this project](https://github.com/dennison-williams-stjames/sji-bdl-client/issues).  Please [add an issue](https://github.com/dennison-williams-stjames/sji-bdl-client/issues/new) if you need development support.

## Things you need to succeed:
- MongoDB (I reccomend you use brew)
- Robo 3T (postico for Mongo)
- Postman (or similar tech for mocking api endpoints)

## Set-up
- fork/clone this repo
- set upstream branch: $`git remote add upstream https://github.com/dennison-williams-stjames/sji-bdl-client`
- run the commands
  - install:          `npm i`
  - *build + nodemon:  `npm run start:dev`
  - *watch:            `npm run watch`

*Development is easier if you run the `start:dev` and `watch` commands simultaneously
in two different shell windows

The original author of this code is [Diana Vashti](https://github.com/DianaVashti/), a talented developer, who is missed.  R.I.P.
