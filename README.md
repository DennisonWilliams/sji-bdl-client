# sj-bdl-client

## Things you need to succeed:
- MongoDB (I reccomend you use brew)
- Robo 3T (postico for Mongo)
- Postman (or similar tech for mocking api endpoints)

## Set-up
- fork/clone this repo
- set upstream branch: $`git remote add upstream https://github.com/dennison-williams-stjames/sji-bdl-client`
- run the commands
  - install:          `npm i`
  - *build + nodemon:  `npm run start:dev`
  - *watch:            `npm run watch`

*Development is easier if you run the `start:dev` and `watch` commands simultaneously
in two different shell windows
